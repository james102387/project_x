# Crystal Development Log

Reverse-chronological record of changes and decisions.

## Active Focus

Update this section each session with current priorities.

- **MVP complete:** All 8 MVP tasks done. KG integration, benchmarks, golden tests all passing.
- **Next milestone:** 2.0 items — multi-hop (dependent detection), mixed prompts, grading rubric.
- **math_augmented cost:** compiled prompts are longer than raw — by design, but worth revisiting.

## 2026-03-14 — MVP Complete: KG Integration + Benchmarks

### What changed
- `CrystalState` schema: added `kg_detections`, `kg_results`, `kg_entities_found` fields
- KG detection node: removed math-priority gate — both math and KG detectors now fire independently
- KG execution node: populates new `kg_results` state field
- Compiler: added `kg_augmented` path (grounded KG facts + reasoning signals → LLM)
- KG detector: added `QUESTION_PREDICATE_MAP` entries (`born → birthplace`, `known → known for`), `why` to question words, subject-entity preference in entity selection
- Metrics: `kg_augmented` treated same as `math_augmented` for savings calculation
- Golden tests: expanded from 8 → 20 KG answerable cases, added 3 KG augmented + 3 KG negative cases
- Benchmark infrastructure: `benchmarks/` with ground truth (20 questions), auto-scoring, baseline and treatment runners
- Treatment benchmark: **100% accuracy** (20/20)
- 167/167 passing, 5 skipped

### Decisions
- `kg_augmented` uses same reasoning signals as `math_augmented` — keeps logic consistent
- Benchmark scoring: substring match (case-insensitive, all match strings must appear)
- Entity selection prefers KG subjects over objects to avoid picking object-only entities as primary

## 2026-03-14 — Module Restructuring

### What changed
- Moved `detectors/calculator.py` + `detectors/semantic.py` into `detectors/math/` subfolder
  - `calculator.py` → `explicit.py`, `semantic.py` unchanged
  - `__init__.py` re-exports all public symbols
- Moved `tools/kg.py` + `tools/remulak_kg.py` into `tools/kg/` subfolder
  - `kg.py` → `graph.py`, `remulak_kg.py` → `remulak.py`
- Renamed `nodes/detector.py` → `nodes/math_detection.py`
- Renamed `nodes/kg_detector.py` → `nodes/kg_detection.py`
- Function names: `math_detection_node`, `kg_detection_node`
- Graph node labels: `"math_detection"`, `"kg_detection"`
- 149/149 passing, 5 skipped

### Decisions
- `semantic.py` grouped with calculator (same detection pipeline)
- Node files use `_detection` (noun) not `_detector` (agent noun) to avoid
  confusion with the actual detector modules in `detectors/`

## 2026-03-08 — Three-View Savings Metrics

### What changed
- Three savings views: `token_savings_pct` (billing), `marginal_savings_pct` (contextual cost), `savings_pct` (legacy)
- New `marginal_cost()` function, `estimate_metrics()` accepts `base_context` param
- 8 new tests; 95/95 passing

### Decisions
- Isolated N+N² overstated penalties ~5x; kept for backwards compat, clearly labelled
