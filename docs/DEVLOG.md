## Active Focus

Update this section each session with current priorities.

- **D1 complete:** Minimal quality rubric implemented — 3-dimension scoring (accuracy, specificity, no-hallucination) across all benchmark paths.
- **Next milestone:** D2 (KG ingestion pipeline), D3 (Web UI), D5 (fuzzy matching).
- **Key insight:** Adversarial negatives revealed that entity-present/predicate-absent queries return full subject scans (kg_answerable), not no_match. The rubric's calibration dimension handles quality evaluation for these cases — the pipeline classification is correct.
- **Test count:** 204 passing, 5 skipped.

## 2026-03-14 — D1: Minimal Quality Rubric

### What changed
- New `benchmarks/rubric.py`: `accuracy_score()`, `specificity_score()`, `grounding_score()`, `calibration_score()`, `score_rubric()`, `RubricResult` dataclass
- Extended `benchmarks/ground_truth.py`: added `is_negative` field (4th tuple element) to all 20 existing cases + 5 adversarial negative cases (GDP, predecessor, second city, oceans, Zelphos population)
- Updated `benchmarks/scoring.py`: added `score_batch_rubric()` that returns per-dimension averages alongside binary correct/incorrect
- Updated `benchmarks/run_benchmark.py`: uses `score_batch_rubric()`, prints per-dimension breakdown and comparison
- New `tests/unit/test_rubric.py`: 25 unit tests covering all scorers + batch integration + backward compatibility
- Extended `tests/golden/test_cases.py`: added `KG_ADVERSARIAL_NEGATIVES` (5 cases)
- Extended `tests/integration/test_pipeline.py`: parametrized tests for adversarial negatives
- 204/204 passing, 5 skipped

### Decisions
- Adversarial negatives where entity exists but predicate doesn't still classify as `kg_answerable` (entity found → subject scan returns all facts). Rubric calibration dimension evaluates quality separately.
- Added "no kg match" to `ABSTENTION_PHRASES` since the treatment pipeline emits `[NO KG MATCH]` for negative cases
- `specificity_score` returns 1.0 for empty `kg_results` (vacuously satisfied) — avoids penalizing non-KG paths

## 2026-03-14 — Roadmap Restructure: Demo Phase

### What changed
- Restructured `TODO.md` from MVP/2.0 into three tiers: MVP (complete), Demo, Future
- Demo phase: 5 tasks (D1–D5) focused on making the value proposition experienceable — quality rubric, KG ingestion pipeline, web UI, augmented benchmarks, fuzzy matching
- Bifurcated `PLAN_GRADING_RUBRIC.md` into Phase 1 (3 dimensions: accuracy, specificity, no-hallucination) and Phase 2 (full 6-metric weighted composite)
- Bifurcated `PLAN_FUZZY_MATCHING.md` into Phase 1 (entity aliases + rapidfuzz, no model downloads) and Phase 2 (embedding similarity via sentence-transformers)
- Promoted fuzzy matching (D5) into Demo tier — exact-match-only entity resolution is a dealbreaker for user-supplied documents

### Decisions
- KG construction (offline batch/ETL) is architecturally separate from query-time pipeline — using an LLM for extraction does not undermine Crystal's deterministic query-time value
- Quality rubric ships with demo but doesn't block it; fuzzy matching is a prerequisite
- Suggested implementation order: D5 (fuzzy) → D2 (ingestion) → D3 (UI) → D1/D4 (rubric + benchmarks)

## 2026-03-14 — MVP Complete: KG Integration + Benchmarks

### What changed
- `CrystalState` schema: added `kg_detections`, `kg_results`, `kg_entities_found` fields
- KG detection node: removed math-priority gate — both math and KG detectors now fire independently
- KG execution node: populates new `kg_results` state field
- Compiler: added `kg_augmented` path (grounded KG facts + reasoning signals → LLM)
- KG detector: added `QUESTION_PREDICATE_MAP` entries (`born → birthplace`, `known → known for`), `why` to question words, subject-entity preference in entity selection
- Metrics: `kg_augmented` treated same as `math_augmented` for savings calculation
- Golden tests: expanded from 8 → 20 KG answerable cases, added 3 KG augmented + 3 KG negative cases
- Benchmark infrastructure: `benchmarks/` with ground truth (20 questions), auto-scoring, baseline and treatment runners
- Treatment benchmark: **100% accuracy** (20/20)
- 167/167 passing, 5 skipped

### Decisions
- `kg_augmented` uses same reasoning signals as `math_augmented` — keeps logic consistent
- Benchmark scoring: substring match (case-insensitive, all match strings must appear)
- Entity selection prefers KG subjects over objects to avoid picking object-only entities as primary

## 2026-03-14 — Module Restructuring

### What changed
- Moved `detectors/calculator.py` + `detectors/semantic.py` into `detectors/math/` subfolder
  - `calculator.py` → `explicit.py`, `semantic.py` unchanged
  - `__init__.py` re-exports all public symbols
- Moved `tools/kg.py` + `tools/remulak_kg.py` into `tools/kg/` subfolder
  - `kg.py` → `graph.py`, `remulak_kg.py` → `remulak.py`
- Renamed `nodes/detector.py` → `nodes/math_detection.py`
- Renamed `nodes/kg_detector.py` → `nodes/kg_detection.py`
- Function names: `math_detection_node`, `kg_detection_node`
- Graph node labels: `"math_detection"`, `"kg_detection"`
- 149/149 passing, 5 skipped

### Decisions
- `semantic.py` grouped with calculator (same detection pipeline)
- Node files use `_detection` (noun) not `_detector` (agent noun) to avoid
  confusion with the actual detector modules in `detectors/`
